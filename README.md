# Carbon Footprint Calculator for Manufacturing Company
This project provides a Python script that calculates the carbon footprint of a manufacturing process. It takes into account energy consumption, material usage, waste production, and shipping distance to provide a brief view of a company's environmental impact.

#Getting Started
These instructions will guide you through setting up the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

# Prerequisites
You need to have Python installed on your machine along with the following libraries:
- matplotlib
- reportlab
- PyPDF2

You can install them using pip:
pip install matplotlib reportlab PyPDF2

# Installing
Clone the repository to your local machine:
git clone https://github.com/ozkoc/carbon_footprint_project
Navigate to the project directory:
cd carbon-footprint-calculator
Run the script:
python main.py

# Usage
Follow the prompts in the command line to input your manufacturing data. The script will calculate the carbon footprint and generate a PDF report with a pie chart visualization.

# Running the Tests
Currently, there are no automated tests for this script.

# Deployment
This script can be integrated into larger systems for continuous monitoring of carbon emissions.

# Contributing
Contributions are welcome! For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
